    <h1>Commandes Composants</h1>
    <h3>Thales - 2021</h3>
    <p><u>Professional Project</u>, Commande Composants is a tool developed in C++/CLI, consisting of a Front-end, a Back-end, and a MySQL database.</p>
    <p>The tool aims to update the company's internal stock of electronic components, assign priorities to certain components, and send email alerts to the managers in charge of placing orders.</p>
    <p>
        The tool has 3 user profiles:
        <li><b>Manager</b>: Allows extraction of data from the ENTIRE site, personalizing alerts, and generating email templates for ordering from suppliers associated with the component.</li>
        <li><b>Technician</b>: Allows adding or removing components from the Stock Database and adding an "urgent" label to certain components.</li>
        <li><b>Admin</b>: Includes the rights of the other users, as well as the ability to add/delete suppliers and reorganize the interface of the other two profiles.</li>

    <h1>TerraHexapode</h1>
    <h3>IMERIR - 2020 / 2022</h3>
    <p><u>Personal Project</u> aiming at designing and building a hexapod robot that carries a plant on its back and autonomously moves in a room to search for solar light sources to power the plant on its back.</p>
    <p>The robot, equipped with 6 legs, 3 leg joints, various sensors (lidar, hygrometric, and photovoltaic sensors, camera), and a Raspberry Pi 4, is equipped with embedded ROS Noetic to manage its movements and algorithmic decisions.</p>
    <p>During its development, several additions and fixes have been made, such as adding human recognition using the camera, detecting the moisture of the plant pot using the hygrometer sensor, recording its environment using the 3D scanner of the room, and obtaining necessary plant data from an internal database fed by Wikipedia.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is capable of providing information about the plant on its back, choosing the best sunlight exposure in the room for it, and searching for human beings when watering is needed based on the hygrometer sensor.</p>

    <h1>AR Racing Game</h1>
    <h3>IMERIR - 2021</h3>
    <p><u>School Project</u> at the end of the year, consisting of developing an augmented reality video game. The project had no specific method or technology requirements, with only a budget of €50, a maximum team size of 5 people, and a duration of 3 weeks.</p>
    <p>Our team, composed of roboticists, AI developers, and embedded systems developers, chose to create a racing game similar to Micro-Machines (NES). The race track is anchored in space using grave QR code tokens detected by webcams.</p>
    <p>To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, we decided to integrate a UR Robotics robotic arm, which allows us to move the QR tokens on the game field during the race using a pneumatic suction cup. This changes the circuit mapping while players compete on it.</p>
    <p>Finally, we added non-player characters (NPCs) to compete against, graded in 4 levels of difficulty.</p>

    <h1>Turtle Bot</h1>
    <h3>IMERIR - 2020</h3>
    <p><u>School Project</u> during the lockdown, aiming to allow real estate agencies to provide 3D tours of rental properties without multiple people being present in a room for a visit.</p>
    <p>We had to assemble a Turtlebot3 (Burger) and add an additional webcam on the floor below the lidar. The objective was to let the robot autonomously move inside the property, scan the rooms using the lidar, take photographs of the environment, and transmit everything to a computer.</p>
    <p>The 3D scan of the property and the photos are then associated using a pre-written C++ program, which provides an integrable file on a web page to allow remote property visits.</p>

    <h1>Médic@</h1>
    <h3>Altran - 2022</h3>
    <p><u>Professional Project</u> aiming to extract data to populate a database and train an AI on it.</p>
    <p>The AI, developed by a French team, is intended to establish a medical diagnosis and provide explanations of appropriate treatments based on the description of pathological symptoms using the medical corpora it has.</p>
    <p>To train this AI, it was necessary to generate Python scripts to search various medical corpus files on the internet, provide the summary of the corpus to the database, the requested keywords, as well as the entire document.</p>

    <h3>Socomec - 2022</h3>
    <p><u>Professional Project</u> aiming to improve and evolve a communication gateway between different electronic measuring devices of the Socomec brand.</p>
    <p>This gateway enables communication with all modules of the same brand, prioritizes information exchange, and sends data to different applications offered by the company (web or software).</p>
